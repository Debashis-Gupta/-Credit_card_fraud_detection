# -Credit_card_fraud_detection

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.So I tried on credit card fraud detection dataset from kaggle to detect the fraud cases. It is basically a categorical implementation to detect normal and fraud transactions.
 
 Here I implemented three algorithms IsolationForest, LocalOutlierFactor, Randomforest and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
 The highlighted remarks of this project is -
 * Comparision between static algorithms and neural network architectural algorithms.
* ANN performs better than IsolationForest and Randomforest.
* Dataset Analysis and Visualization
